## Hi, I'm Hasan 👋

I'm a data practitioner trying to reinvent my career 🚑️

Currently interested in learning about the cryptic concept of implementing streamlined procedures within the constantly expanding data landscape.

### Personal work

      A simple cli tool for manually renaming your lake files ♿️

      This was before I realized that the Lakehouse solution exists
